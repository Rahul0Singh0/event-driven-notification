# Event-Driven Notification System  
**Node.js · TypeScript · Express · RabbitMQ · Swagger · Docker**

This repository contains a **practice project** demonstrating a **real-world event-driven architecture** using **RabbitMQ**.  
Services communicate asynchronously using events instead of direct API calls.

The project is designed for **learning backend architecture**, **message queues**, and **microservices fundamentals**.

---

## Architecture Overview


### Key Principles
- Loose coupling between services
- Asynchronous communication
- Event-based architecture
- Scalable consumer design

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript (ES Modules)
- Express.js
- RabbitMQ
- Swagger (OpenAPI YAML)
- Docker
- YAML-based configuration
- tsx + nodemon
